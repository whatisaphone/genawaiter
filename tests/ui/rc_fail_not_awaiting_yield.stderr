error[E0499]: cannot borrow `co` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> $DIR/rc_fail_not_awaiting_yield.rs:6:15

5 |     let foo = co.yield_(10);
  |               -- first mutable borrow occurs here
6 |     let bar = co.yield_(20);
  |               ^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
7 | }
  | - first borrow might be used here, when `foo` is dropped and runs the destructor for type `impl std::future::Future`
